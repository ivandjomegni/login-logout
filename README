Using Apache, PHP and MySQL to create a web application that demonstrates the ability to integrate server scripting, html presentation and 
database management. 

Key features of the project must include:

1. The ability to allow users to register an account on the site. This should at a minimum require a username, password and a preferred 
background image. The choice of background images can be hard coded into a selection list, and must provide a preview of the selected 
image using AJAX. Ideally the password must be stored in an encrypted form.

2. The enforcement of users to be logged on to view all pages in the site other than those required to complete a registration. 
If a non-logged on user attempts to access a protected page please issue a warning screen and then provide a way to display the logon 
page.

3. A way for a user to logoff.

4. Ability to display all registered users, update the registration of any user and delete a userâ€™s registration.

5. Utilize a session variable to display in a header who is logged in on every page. Also use a session variable to store the background 
required for the logged on user.
